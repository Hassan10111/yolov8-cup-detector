# yolov8-cup-detector
Custom object detection project using YOLOv8 to detect cups. Trained with Roboflow dataset in Google Colab, supports image predictions, validation.

This project demonstrates a custom object detection pipeline using YOLOv8 to detect cups in images and videos.
The model was trained on a dataset prepared in Roboflow, trained and tested in Google Colab, and supports both test image predictions and webcam-based detection.
